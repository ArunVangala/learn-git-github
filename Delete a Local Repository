1. Delete a Local Repository

A local Git repository is just a folder with a hidden .git folder inside. To delete it:
Navigate to the parent folder of your repo:
cd "C:\Users\DELL\OneDrive\Desktop\Git Repo"

Delete the folder completely:
rm -Recurse -Force MyNewProject

This removes the entire project folder and the repository locally.
On Windows, you can also just right-click → Delete the folder in File Explorer.
Warning: This permanently deletes all local files in the folder.

2. Delete a Remote Repository on GitHub
Go to GitHub → Your Repositories → Select the repository you want to delete.
Click Settings (top-right of the repo page).
Scroll down to Danger Zone → Delete this repository.
Click Delete this repository, confirm by typing the repository name, and confirm.
Warning: This permanently deletes the repository from GitHub and cannot be undone. Make sure you have a local backup if needed.
