. git pull origin main – Local Command in VS Code
What it does:
git pull origin main


git pull → Fetches the latest changes from the remote repository and merges them into your current branch.

origin → The name of the remote repository (default is origin).

main → The branch you want to pull from.

Step-by-Step Explanation:

Git contacts GitHub (or remote repo).

Downloads any new commits from main branch.

Merges those commits into your current local branch.

Resolves conflicts if any, or asks you to resolve them manually.

Example Scenario:

You are on your branch feature/login-enhancement.

Someone else pushed changes to main on GitHub.

Running:

git pull origin main


Updates your local branch with the latest changes from main, so you don’t accidentally overwrite them when you merge later.

🔹 2. Pull Request (PR) on GitHub – Browser

A Pull Request (PR) is a GitHub feature used for reviewing and merging code between branches.

How it works:

You push your branch to GitHub:

git push -u origin feature/login-enhancement


Go to GitHub → your repository → you’ll see a “Compare & Pull Request” button.

Open the PR → GitHub shows:

Changes in your branch vs main

Any conflicts with main

Option for reviewers to approve

Once approved → click Merge Pull Request → merges your branch into main on GitHub.

🔹 Difference Between git pull and Pull Request
Local Command (git pull)	GitHub Pull Request
Updates your local branch with changes from remote.	Proposes merging your branch into another branch (main) on GitHub.
Run in terminal/VS Code.	Run in web browser.
Can auto-merge or show conflicts locally.	Can review, discuss, and approve changes before merging.
Typically used before pushing your branch to avoid conflicts.	Used to merge feature branches into main safely in a team environment.
🔹 Real-Time Workflow Example

You are working on feature/login locally.

Someone updated main on GitHub.

Step 1 (Local Sync):

git checkout feature/login
git pull origin main


Brings your branch up-to-date with latest main changes.

Step 2 (Push Your Feature):

git push origin feature/login


Step 3 (GitHub Pull Request):

Open PR → Review → Merge → main now has your feature.
